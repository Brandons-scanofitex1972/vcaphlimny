Dude, just got through Home Sweet Home: Rebirth and honestly, my brain's like scrambled eggs right now. Like, what did I even 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? It started all fine, cozy feels, and next thing you know, BAM! It's like every horror trope rolled into one crazy burrito. You know what I mean? Anyway, I'm here thinking, if I could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   directly into my head just to make sense of it, I totally would.

So many jump scares, I swear! My heart gets a workout more than I do, LOL. And the characters, oh boy, don't even get me started. They're both super annoying and strangely relatable at the same time? Like, seriously, one minute you're rooting for them, next minute you're like, Okay, you're too dumb to live. You get what I'm saying, right?

My fave part though has to be the soundtrack! They nailed it. The music was this weird mix of creepy and oddly comforting. I almost wanted to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   all over again just for that, except my nerves can't take another beating tonight.

>Why do all these 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 have that one genius kid who figures everything out, while the adults are basically bumbling around in the dark? It's hilarious and a little bit tragic. Still, you gotta love it. Or maybe I'm just too tired to think rationally right now.

And talk about plot twists! My eyes almost fell out of my head at some points. Plot weaving in and out like it’s playing jump rope with my sanity. You could tell they were trying real hard, and I give them props for that even if it's all smushed together like a horror sandwich. IDK, it’s kind of entertaining in a really messy way.

Say what you will, though, it’s these messed up, adrenaline-fueled marathons that keep me going back. So, hey, if you're up for it, let's totally rant about it more tomorrow. If my brain hasn't rebooted by then, haha!

int chaosLevel = 9000; // why did I even put this here???

Anyway, that's my quick post-  brain dump... Hope I wasn't just blabbing nonsense. But you know me, I could talk about this kinda stuff for days, LOL. Let me know what you think if you ever 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it! Or, y'know, don’t. 카드가 뭐지? 나도 모르겠어. 🤷‍♂️
